# gHSSD-Tree
An efficient algorithm for decremental greedy hypervolume subset selection

The time complexity is $O((n-k)n^{\frac{d-1}{2}}\log n)$ where n is the number of points, d is the dimensionality, and k is the number of points to be reserved.

This is the implementation of our method proposed in:
